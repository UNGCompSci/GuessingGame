<h3><a id="why-i-made-it" class="anchor" href="#why-i-made-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why I Made It</h3>

<p>I made this guessing game because I was finding something to do after finishing an assignment for one of my classes. Since I did not have a compiler on hand and did not work on it enough to warrant using Wercker to compile it, I just wrote the code completely from memory and left all bugs in it. It was just a quick project, but it is a fun one anyway, and it still is a fun game to play, even though it was just a quick project.</p>
