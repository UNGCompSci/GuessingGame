<p>The Time Machine android app is a phone app that can serve multiple purposes with the same function.</p>

<ol>
<li>Education</li>

<ul>
<li>The Time Machine app can be educational when museums or other historical places create videos of events occurring such as the signing of the Declaration of Independence or the soldiers trapped on Andersonville (even though there is now grass there, but it is still a great idea for education).</li>
</ul>
<li>Security</li>

<ul>
<li>Places that want three dimensional film for security can run cameras around a room or a certain spot they want secured and the footage can be viewed live or recorded. When recorded, the person who is trying to figure out who broke into the area, can see the event as if it is happening when he or she is in the room itself.</li>
</ul>
<li>Entertainment</li>

<ul>
<li>Just like security, different places like sports channels and movie companies can record the shows or movies in the three dimensional view, and the viewer can view it as if he or she is actually there, sort of like virtual reality, which is how the footage is being used in this case. This can be paired with an existing virtual reality set to produce the realistic images or can be viewed from the phone app using Augmented Reality if the person does not own a virtual reality kit.</li>
</ul>
