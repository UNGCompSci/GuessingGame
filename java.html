<h3><a id="what-is-this" class="anchor" href="#what-is-this" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What Is This?</h3>
<p>This page is only here to test Pygments and Redcarpet. It is not intended to be part of the actual site, but I am leaving the page here to demonstrate syntax highlighting. The command I used to generate the css file responsible for syntax highlighting is pygmentize -S default -f html > stylesheets/pygment_trac.css. After some experimentation I found that different styles besides default exist e.g. autumn. Styles can be listed by using the command pygmentize -L styles.</p>
